# Cleanup
* There are some classes that should be ids. i.e. elements that are not supposed to repeat.
* Sponsor background should be cleanedup.
* Logo looks messy in upper left corner.

# misc
* website should branch to other pages
 * gather intended branching structure
* Each team uses their own github to organize their work. This should really be multiple repos under the same org.
 * The org could be "Lyra" for example, then the repos would be lyra-{teamname}.
